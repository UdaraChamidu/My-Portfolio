**Facephi AI Identity: Solid Results, Strong Growth**

Facephi, a leader in AI/ML-powered digital identity verification, reported solid first-half 2025 results with unprecedented positive free cash flow and near break-even EBITDA. The company anticipates strong acceleration in the second half of 2025 and projects substantial revenue and EBITDA growth through 2026.

**Gemini AI boosts Android development.**

Google is integrating its Gemini AI tools to significantly enhance and "supercharge" Android development. This move aims to boost the capabilities and efficiency for developers on the platform.

**UK Automotive Acoustics: AI/ML Drives Growth**

The UK automotive acoustic engineering services market is growing, driven by factors like EV adoption. A key trend and opportunity involves the increasing integration of AI and machine learning for advanced acoustic analysis to enhance NVH control and meet regulations.

**Alif MCUs accelerate generative AI at the edge.**

Alif Semiconductor's Ensemble MCUs are now the industry's first to provide hardware acceleration for transformer networks, thanks to new ExecuTorch Runtime support. This enables local generative AI inference directly on edge and endpoint devices.

**Alif MCUs Accelerate Generative AI Transformers at Edge**

Alif Semiconductor's Ensemble MCUs (E4/E6/E8) are now the first MCUs to provide hardware acceleration for transformer networks, elevating generative AI at the edge. With new support for ExecuTorch Runtime, these MCUs enable local generative AI inference directly on edge and endpoint devices.
